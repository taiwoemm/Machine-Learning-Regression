# Machine-Learning-Regression
Project on predicting the time to clear out accident scenes in Denton county, Texas, with ML regression models

The main objective of this project is to create a model that can predict the amount of time (in minutes) it will take to clear an accident scene (referred to as the "y" value). The time taken to clear an accident scene plays a vital role in identifying the emergency response efficiency and managing traffic disruptions caused by accidents. 

The model will be developed using various features from the dataset, including crash severity, weather conditions, speed limits, and more, to make predictions about the clearance time. 

Machine learning regression techniques was applied to construct this predictive model, and regression analysis was used to predict which may be appropriate for predicting the continuous "time scene cleared" variable.
